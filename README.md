## Project Description *(Software Lead)*
our project is a trend guessing game, where a random hashtag from twitter is shown. This hastag, called the Base Trend (BT), is shown along with the number of tweets associated with it, which is then compared to another random hashtag, called the Comparison Trend(CT). The user has to guess whether or not the CT has more or less tweets associated with then the BT.

We will start off working with pygame and once we have work that fulfills the requirements of the project we will incorporate our work into a website and ideally an app.

## User Interface Design *(Front End Specialist)*
* << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. >>
	![Main Menu](assets/MainMenu.jpg)
	![Game Over](assets/GameOver.jpg)
	![Selection](assets/Selection.jpg)
	![Settings](assets/Settings.jpg)

    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
* << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![general structure](assets/general_structure.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

## Project Structure *(Software Lead)*

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:
* main.py
* bin
    * apiCall.py
    * apiCodes.py
    * tweepy
    * Codes.Zip
    * trends.txt
* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc,  gshouldo here)
    * MainMenu.jpg
    * Settings.jpg
    * general_structure.jpg
    * Selection.jpg
    * GameOver.jpg
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>

## Tasks and Responsibilities *(Software Lead)*
* You must outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.

| Step                  | Procedure     | Expected Results  | Actual Results |
| ----------------------|:-------------:| -----------------:| -------------- |
|  1  | Open terminal, navigate to folder, and type, â€œpython3 main.py" | More or Less starts and shows the Main Menu GUI |          |
|  2  | Enter username  | Username updates to the user input |                 |
|  3  | Play game by clicking "Play" with mouse |  runs apiCall.py file which updates the trends.json, starts GameLoop and transitions to game GUI, showing a base trend with a tweet count and a comparison trend, both pulled from the trends.json file|     |
|  4  | User presses the correct button in game GUI|returns new comparison trend and makes current comparison trend into base trend|     |
|  5  | User presses the incorect button in game GUI| ends game and shows the end game GUI|       |
|  6  | click on the "Leaderboard" option in the Game Over menu" | GUI transitions to leaderboard, shows top ten high scores |       |
|  7  | click "Main Menu" in the Leaderboard GUI | Transitions to the Main Menu GUI again |       |
|  8  | click "theme" in the Main Menu | toggles between Light Mode and Dark Mode |       |
|  9  | click "quit" in the Main Menu | exits program |     |
