## Project Description *(Software Lead)*
Our project is a trend guessing game, where a random hashtag from twitter is shown. This hastag, called the Base Trend (BT), is shown along with the number of tweets associated with it, which is then compared to another random hashtag, called the Comparison Trend(CT). The user has to guess whether or not the CT has more or less tweets than the BT. Upon a successful guess, a point is added to the user's score. The object of the game is to obtain the highest score possible. The game ends when the user makes an incorrect guess on what trend has more tweets. Upon losing, the user is presnted with their score, and the number of tweets the CT and BT had. 

We will start off working with pygame and once we have work that fulfills the requirements of the project we will incorporate our work into a website and ideally an app.

## User Interface Design 
* Initial GUI concepts
	* ![Main Menu Concept](assets/MainMenu.jpg)
	* ![Selection Concept](assets/Selection.jpg)
	* ![Game Over Concept](assets/GameOver.jpg)
	* ![Settings Concept](assets/Settings.jpg)
	
* Final GUI 
	* ![Main Menu Light](assets/LightMainMenuFinal.png)
	* ![Main Menu Dark](assets/DarkMainMenuFinal.png)
	* ![Leaderboard Light](assets/LightLeaderboardFinal.png)
	* ![Leaderboard Dark](assets/DarkLeaderboardFinal.png)
	* ![Selection Light](assets/LightSelectionFinal.png)
	* ![Selection Dark](assets/DarkSelectionFinal.png)
	* ![Game Over Light](assets/LightGameOverFinal.png)
	* ![Game Over Dark](assets/DarkGameOverFinal.png)

	* Main Menu:Presents our game's title, along with buttons allowing the user to start the game, view a leaderboard, or access settings.
	* Selection:Users are presented with two tweets, and must chose which has more tweets. They may click either option, or access settings. Orininally the options would have photos, but some trending twitter topics are controversial so this idea was scrapped.
	* Game Over:Users are shown which tweet had more tweets, and have the options to play again, view the leaderboard, or access settings.
	* Leaderboard:Users are presented a list of up to ten other players with their highest scores to see where they rank in comparison to others. If there are less than ten players in the user info, then there are filler posistions displayed where the player name is "Player" and the Score is N/A.
	* Settings:Users have the ability to make the game full screen, or change other game settings. This menu was later scrapped and integrated with the main menu.

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*
* Non-Standard libraries
    * pygame 
        * https://www.pygame.org/ 
        * Module set incorporating many common game development functions into python. Handles all the graphical elements in our code
    * Tweepy 
        * https://www.tweepy.org/
        * Easy to use python library for accessing the Twitter API. Returns raw data for real time trending topics in the Twitter app. 
    * Pygame Menus
        * https://pypi.org/project/pygame-menu/
        * Library for creating menus and GUIS. Gives people the ability to add visuals to their code. 
        
    
    *
* Class Interface Design
    * ![general structure](assets/general_structure.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * apiCall
    * button 
    * label
    * Controller

## Project Structure *(Software Lead)*

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:
* main.py
* bin
    * apiCall.py
    * apiCodes.py
    * tweepy
    * Codes.Zip
    * trends.txt
* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc,  gshouldo here)
    * MainMenu.jpg
    * Settings.jpg
    * general_structure.jpg
    * Selection.jpg
    * GameOver.jpg
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>

## Tasks and Responsibilities *(Software Lead)*
* You must outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.

### Software Lead - Senih O

<< Worked as integration specialist by... >>

### Front End Specialist - Clay B

Front-end lead conducted significant research on making GUIs in pygame and the pygame-menus library. We wanted to ensure the menus we created were high quality and functional, so Clay researched a libarary to help us with this. In addition, Clay wrote the GUI portions of our controller class, coded our menus, and was responsible for placing our models on screen.

### Back End Specialist - Sharan S

Back-end was responsible for taking raw data from API and formatting it to work with rest of program. The base trends and comparison trends are random items from the list in trends.json, and if they were the same, the comparison trend would be a different trend. Back end also had to make sure the userinfo.json file would be updated if a new player is added or if there is a new high score is reached. 

## Testing *(Software Lead)*
* << Describe your testing strategy for your project. >>
    * << Example >>

* Your ATP

| Step                  | Procedure     | Expected Results  | Actual Results |
| ----------------------|:-------------:| -----------------:| -------------- |
|  1  | Open terminal, navigate to folder, and type, â€œpython3 main.py" | More or Less starts and shows the Main Menu GUI |          |
|  2  | Enter username  | Username updates to the user input |                 |
|  3  | Play game by clicking "Play" with mouse |  runs apiCall.py file which updates the trends.json, starts GameLoop and transitions to game GUI, showing a base trend with a tweet count and a comparison trend, both pulled from the trends.json file|     |
|  4  | User presses the correct button in game GUI|returns new comparison trend and makes current comparison trend into base trend|     |
|  5  | User presses the incorect button in game GUI| ends game and shows the end game GUI|       |
|  6  | click on the "Leaderboard" option in the Game Over menu" | GUI transitions to leaderboard, shows top ten high scores |       |
|  7  | click "Main Menu" in the Leaderboard GUI | Transitions to the Main Menu GUI again |       |
|  8  | click "theme" in the Main Menu | toggles between Light Mode and Dark Mode |       |
|  9  | click "quit" in the Main Menu | exits program |     |
etc...
